## Question and Background Information

### Question

> Based on location, origin, time and other data about a fire, can our model predict the amount of time it will take the Charlottesville,
> VA firefighters to put the fire out?

This question is important to ask because a model can help fire departments predict how long a fire will take to put out at any given
address, time, or origin of the fire. Ideally, if a department gets a call about a fire, and they know the address, time, origin of the
fire, etc, they can predict within a reasonable range how long it will take for the firefighters and resources to be back to the station
to be ready to go fight the next fire. Helping fire departments understand how many resources they need and how they can spread out these
resources can assist in making fire response more equitable regardless of area. 

### Background Information
This data was collected by the City of Charlottesville, VA, originally published in August of 2020 and later updated in September 2020.
The fire incidents reported occurred from 04/2002-9/2019. We need to consider a few fire response variables as explained in
[a 2013 study thattalks about Data Model Development for Fire Related Extreme Events](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43825940).

## Data Prep

### loading in the data and packages needed

library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)

fires = read.csv("Historical_Fire_Data.csv")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
### casting the empties as NAs

str(fires)
fires[fires ==" "] <- NA
```

```{r include=FALSE}
### getting rid of unneeded columns

fires = select(fires, -c(1,2,3,4,16,17,18,19,20))
```

```{r include=FALSE}
### turning necessary columns into factors

str(fires)
fires[,c(2,3,4,5,7,11,12)] <- lapply(fires[,c(2,3,4,5,7,11,12)], as.factor)

```

```{r include=FALSE}
### Converting datetime string into season and time of day

# Get a POSIXct datetime object from the string in the dataset
fires$AlarmDateTimeAmericaNY <- as.POSIXct(fires$AlarmDateTimeAmericaNY , format="%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S+00", tz="EST")

# Extract the date from the POSIXct object, convert it to a factor and collapse the factor into seasons
fires$season <- format(as.Date(fires$AlarmDateTimeAmericaNY), "%m")
fires$season <- as.factor(fires$season)
fires$season <- fct_collapse(fires$season,
                             Winter = c("01", "02", "03"),
                             Spring = c("04", "05", "06"),

                             Fall = c("10", "11", "12"))

# Extract the time from the POSIXct object, convert it to a factor and collapse the factor into seasons
fires$time <- format(fires$AlarmDateTimeAmericaNY, "%H")
fires$time <- as.factor(fires$time)
fires$time <- fct_collapse(fires$time,
                           Morning = c("06", "07", "08", "09", "10", "11"),
                           Afternoon = c("12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17"),
                           Evening = c("18", "19", "20", "21", "22", "23"),
                           Night = c("00", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05"))

# Drop the original datetime variable since it's no longer necessary
fires <- fires[, -1]
```

```{r include=FALSE}
### Missing data
mice::md.pattern(fires, rotate.names=TRUE)

# Fill in all NAs in factors with the string "Unknown"
fires[,c(1,2,3,4,6,10)] <- lapply(fires[,c(1,2,3,4,6,10)], addNA)
```

### re-run missing data analysis

mice::md.pattern(fires, rotate.names=TRUE)

# Keep only complete cases
fires <- fires[complete.cases(fires), ]
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We first looked at the distribution of our target variable:

```{r}
d <- density(fires$IncidentDurationMinutes)
plot(d, main="Duration of fire incident")
polygon(d, col="darkmagenta", border="darkmagenta")
```

```{r}
d <- density(fires$IncidentDurationMinutes)
plot(d, main="Duration of fire incident",
     log="x",
     xlab="Minutes")
```

We then looked at a number of variables within our dataset (after data prep) that we thought might be useful for predicting incident length:

```{r}
barplot(table(fires$FireType),
        main="Type of Fire",
        ylab="Number of Incidents",
        col="darkmagenta",
        las=2)
```

```{r}
barplot(table(fires$PropertyUse),
        main="Property Use",
        ylab="Number of Incidents",
        col="darkmagenta",
        las=2)
```

## Methods

We are interested in creating a regression model, and using NRMSE and R^2 as our primary evaluation metrics. Our aim is to create a model that predicts incident duration with reasonable accuracy, specifically, we want our model to be less than 20 minutes off after fine-tuning the model and adjusting its hyperparameter.

The maxdepth analysis and decision tree from our initial model are as follows:

```{r include=FALSE}
### splitting into train, tune, test

set.seed(3001)
part_index_1 <- caret::createDataPartition(fires$IncidentDurationMinutes,
                                           times=1,
                                           p = 0.80,
                                           groups=1,
                                           list=FALSE)

train <- fires[part_index_1, ]
tune_and_test <- fires[-part_index_1, ]

#We need to use the function again to create the tuning set 
set.seed(3001)
tune_and_test_index <- createDataPartition(tune_and_test$IncidentDurationMinutes,
                                           p = .5,
                                           list = FALSE,
                                           times = 1)

tune <- tune_and_test[tune_and_test_index, ]
test <- tune_and_test[-tune_and_test_index, ]


dim(train)
dim(test) 
dim(tune)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
## Decision Tree model

### Creating and training the model

features <- train[, -5] # Remove incident duration since it's the target variable

target <- train$IncidentDurationMinutes

str(features)
str(target)

# We want to do 10-fold cross validation 5 times
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                          number = 50,
                          repeats = 5)

# train the model
set.seed(1984)
duration_model_dt <- train(x=features,
                            y=target,
                            method="rpart2",
                            trControl=fitControl,
                            metric="RMSE")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
### Running and Evaluating the model

duration_model_dt
```

```{r}
plot(duration_model_dt)
```

A maximum depth of 2 clearly had the lowest RMSE, so it was chosen.

```{r}
varImp(duration_model_dt)
```

Property Loss was by far the most important variable in the dataset, followed by Fire Type and Area of Origin.

```{r}
rpart.plot(duration_model_dt$finalModel, type=5,extra=101)
```

This confirms that Property Loss was the most important variable.

___

The maxdepth analysis and decision tree from our tuned model are as follows:

```{r include=FALSE}
### Adjusting the hyperparameter

tree.grid <- expand.grid(maxdepth=c(3:20))

# training the model with the adjusted hyperparameter
set.seed(1984)
duration_model_dt_1 <- train(x=features,
                            y=target,
                            method="rpart2",
                            trControl=fitControl,
                           tuneGrid=tree.grid,
                            metric="RMSE")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
### Running and Evaluating the new model

duration_model_dt_1
```

```{r}
plot(duration_model_dt_1)
```

This time, a maximum depth of 5 was chosen.

```{r}
varImp(duration_model_dt_1)
```

The variables of importance were largely unchanged.

```{r}
rpart.plot(duration_model_dt_1$finalModel, type=5,extra=101)
```

The tree makes use of more variables now.







## Evaluation

### Original Model

```{r include=FALSE}

grade_pred_reg <- predict(duration_model_dt, tune)
```

```{r}
postResample(pred = grade_pred_reg, obs = tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
range(tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)
555.3 - 6.4

# Get the nrmse
duration_dt_rmse <- postResample(pred = grade_pred_reg, obs = tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)[1]
```

NRMSE:

```{r}
(duration_dt_rmse / (mean(tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)))
```

### Tuned model

```{r include=FALSE}
grade_pred_reg <- predict(duration_model_dt_1, tune)
```

```{r}
postResample(pred = grade_pred_reg, obs = tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
range(tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)
555.3 - 6.4

# Get the nrmse
duration_dt_rmse_1 <- postResample(pred = grade_pred_reg, obs = tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)[1]
```

```{r}
(duration_dt_rmse_1 / (mean(tune$IncidentDurationMinutes)))
```

Our original model had an NRMSE of 113.4% and r^2 was 0.41. Neither metric changed significantly after fine-tuning our model
and adjusting the hyperparameter (max depth).

### Evaluating with the Tuned model on the Test set

```{r include=FALSE}
grade_pred_reg <- predict(duration_model_dt_1, test)
```

```{r}
postResample(pred = grade_pred_reg, obs = test$IncidentDurationMinutes)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
range(test$IncidentDurationMinutes)
555.3 - 6.4

# Get the nrmse
duration_dt_rmse_1 <- postResample(pred = grade_pred_reg, obs = test$IncidentDurationMinutes)[1]
```

```{r}
(duration_dt_rmse_1 / (mean(test$IncidentDurationMinutes)))
```

Our final predictions had an NRMSE of 176.2% and an r^2 value of 0.35 .

This means that, on average, the error of the predicted duration was 176.2% of the average incident duration, and so
the average prediction was almost 103 minutes off. This is unacceptable, because having predictions that are almost two hours
off on average would cause chaos if used in a real fire station because it would result in frequent over- and understaffing.  

## Fairness Assessment

We do not necessarily have any protected classes, but it could be could to consider that our dataset did not contain any fires
that 911 was not called for. It is worth noting that the results of our model will only be applicable to the Charlottesville area.
If someone wanted to use our model in another location, they would need to train it using local data at that location.

## Conclusions

After trying around four model types within our skillset, we landed on a Decision Tree model, which gave us the best results with an
average error of 103 minutes and R Squared of 0.35 . With the limitations of our model and it’s current level of capability to predict
a future incident’s duration time, we cannot confidently rely on this model to help a fire department’s efficiency. Predicting a duration
of time with over an hour of error is not close to adequate for a workable system for the Charlottesville Fire Department when lives are
on the line. However, our ideology can be applied to larger datasets, with presumably better results.

## Limitations and Future Work

One of the limitations is our limited sample size. The dataset had a little over 2000 samples which can be hard to draw solid
conclusions from as the model has a limited number of previous values to use in order to help make future predictions. Our data also contained
at least one NA per every row, and that really limited the possibilities. Our dataset may also have lacked certain features that would
have been helpful in predicting incident duration.
